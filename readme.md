# Ducksplash for Game Boy

A small Game Boy game. You play as a duck who moves around the screen to eat fish. (TODO: Add fish.)

## Demo

## Building

Building this project requires `make` and the [RGBDS](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/) toolchain to be installed. Once the prerequisites are installed, just run `make` and find the output ROM at `build/ducksplash.gb`.

## Purpose

This was my first attempt at writing a retro console game. There's lots to be improved and fully understood.

The [Game Boy Pan Docs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/), the [Game Boy ASM Tutorial](https://gbdev.io/gb-asm-tutorial/index.html), and [The Ultimate Game Boy Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyzD8pNlpwI) are awesome guides.
